## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings

First of all, in order to run the application, you need to create an `.env` file in the root directory, in which you will define the application's environment variables.

Starting with the database connection environment variables, you will need to configure the following variables:

```
POSTGRES_DB=<the database name>
POSTGRES_USER=<the database username>
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<the database user‚Äôs password>
DB_PORT=<the host port of your database>

# pay attention to setting the correct values in the database URL
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<database username>:<database password>@db:<database port>/<database name>?schema=public
```

Once the database variables have been defined, you will need to define other service environment variables related to security, service integration and other details that are important for the smooth running of the application.

````
# SERVICES PORTS
# You can set the ports however you like
API_PORT=<The pattern is 3000>
FRONTEND_PORT=<The patterns is 3001>

# SECURITY
JWT_SECRET_KEY=<set your secret key to make your API more secure!>
ENCRYPT_SALT=<set an ecrypt salt>
````

Whew! To complete our configuration, you just need to set some environment variables to allow the application to send emails using the `nodemailer` library. You will need to set the environment variables below:

````
# EMAIL SENDER
MAILER_USER=<your e-mail address>
MAILER_PASS=<your e-mail password>
MAILER_SENDER=<the e-mail address responsible for sending the e-mails>
MAILER_HOST=<the SMTP host based on your e-mail address>
````

Yahoo! You have finished configuring the application and should now be able to run it on your own device.
